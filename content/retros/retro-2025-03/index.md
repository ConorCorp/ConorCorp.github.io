For the second year in a row I've missed the February retrospective. Totally fell through the cracks some how.

I guess I'll use my goals from January here.

# How did I do with last month's goals?

## Music - [Solo Project](https://www.linktr.ee/se.corp) | [Band Project](https://www.corp.band)

### Finish 1 SE.CORP song
- Result: F
I have around 5 50-75% finished songs, which have actually been fun to make. But I just need to set aside a weekend when we've finished modergator to get really finish them.

## Side Projects

### Have Modergator shipped.
- Results: B
Modergator was shipped, although not in Feb but in March. I'm happy with the product, but we really don't have anyone using it yet. Still have some main stuff to build before we aim to shut it by the end of next month (hopefully) if it doesn't work.

Our release was basically to nobody, see this [post](/posts/thoughts-after-releasing-modergator/). That hurts.

Since then I set up X and google ads. Only today have we had our first few signups.

Bit of a lull in this project the last 2 weeks due to me being on tour and maybe just being busy? but also trying to define direction? Also probably my brother moving over.

## Personal

### Final tax return for SkinTheory
- Results: A
Completed. Just need to shut the bank account.


# What else got done last month?
- CORP. played a 4 date irish tour
  - This was pretty fun but was hard on the body between the driving, setting up, playing, tearing down, drinking, talking, etc.
  - We didn't get a whole lot of random traffic at the shows but it was still enjoyable and a fun way to meet Drying Weather
- I posted this [post](/posts/thoughts-after-releasing-modergator/) but didn't really get any eyes on it
- I posted this [post](/posts/dev-tip-chrome/) which really only got hate on it
- My brother moved to Germany so I've been helping him a bit and hanging out
- I fixed my Ableton push 2 after messing it up the first time. Yay! Just needed a good clean inside really.
- I got a new VPN: [windscribe](https://windscribe.com)

# Lessons Learned?
- I need to build stuff that catches attention in headlines. I explore that in my [post](/posts/thoughts-after-releasing-modergator/)
  - Also, to extend this, building really cool demos that do the talking instead of just saying stuff in a headline
- Google/X ads bring in some viewership to apps
- Tours are hard on the body and you likely won't get a big audience unless its assured it gets foot traffic (which is rare)
- The Ableton Push 2 is easy to maintain, just make sure you don't leave dust inside electronics and close it all 100% correct without forcing components

# What are my goals for next month?
- Do enough marketing to say we can end modergator or stick with it
- Fill out YC App for modergator
- Finish US Taxes
- Update my investments

# What are my 2024 (year) goals?

1. ðŸŸ¡ Release/Work on 3 startup projects. Build them faster, throw them out faster.
   - I need to build quickly and release quickly. I need to clear time in my schedule for this.
   - Related lifetime goal: Run my own business.
2. ðŸŸ¡ Show off 12 items of my work in public. 1 per month atleast.
   - I should build my projects in public. I should have my music out in public more. I should write blog posts. I enjoy the feedback.
   - Related lifetime goal: Run my own business / Have 100k fans of my music.
3. ðŸŸ¡ Curate and keep to a more regular routine. 6hr side projects. Wake up by 8am.
   - Atleast 6hrs per week on music / side projects.
     - Decide on Sundays what I want to achieve with the week
   - Wake up by 8 regularly and work on my projects in the morning.
     - I do better work in the morning and need to keep this routine. Otherwise I'm tired at night and just watch tv.
   - Reduce my obligations/stress so that I have time to work on projects / music. I feel stressed with all the things I must do. I don't have time for my passions then, and I also can't stop and smell the roses in life.
   - Define what I'll achieve each week.
4. ðŸ”´ Release 4 SE.CORP songs. Set up a repeatable way to get listeners / viewers.
5. ðŸŸ¡ Develop a better musical ear 
   - I'd like to more readily be able to find notes, tab out songs, and jam over other songs


# What are my lifetime goals?

1. Run my own business that allows me to: support myself, be relaxed, be innovative, love my work, travel.
2. Backpack for 6 months through Asia.
3. Have 100,000 fans of my music.
4. Be relaxed and be excited to wake up to my life every day, and these days are meaningful long-term.
