Typing this up from my lovely beach holidy in Sicily. The room is kind of cramped and the wifi meh, but the headspace is unbeatable 🏖️

# How did I do with last month's goals?

## Music - [Solo Project](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4w77ipMn1jGx4ppm7HNYZK?si=Y5sY7-rrSV-U8j3-8AkMYA) | [Band Project](www.corp.band)

### Fully Plan Out Release Chlorine

*   Results: B-

The song is completely mastered, although I'm not sure its perfect. It's time to release anyway, I've spent enough time on it. I've got some good inspiration from Reels to use for my video. I need to start copying formats a bit more. Everyone else does it online, even people I respect, its what people want to see, and it makes it way faster to produce videos, especially for someone like me who isn't skilled with video.

I've shot some videos with a mate of mine now and so there's just a few more steps until release. Now I just need to:

*   Put some finishing touches on the videos.

*   Set up a release schedule

*   Change my name to c.corp.

*   Release the videos.

I also found the the mixing/mastering I did ate up a bunch of time and I'm not in love with the result. I need to work on delegating what I can with mixing/mastering.

## Side Projects

### Expatpho.net Self Service Plan

*   Results: B-

Didn't work on this an insane amount this month, but got some bits done.

Conall and I have almost finished all the work with expatpho.net to work on auto pilot. We still just need to:

*   Finish the refund frontend/backend

*   Do my basic marketing

*   Remove the refund section from the landing page.

I've been getting slowly more bearish on the project and want to free up some space in my head to start on the next one, especially if I want to reach my 3 startup projects for the year goal. I'll have more time next month to hopefully finish the work.

### Finish SkinTheory closing documents

*   Results: F

Yea, I just didn't get around to this. SkinTheory will have to be closed next month.

## Personal

### Complete My German Taxes

*   Results: A+

Finished these on my own with Steuergo and without a Steuerberater. Took a while, and I'm chancing my arm a bit, but I think I'll get money back.

### Complete Habit Rings 5/7 days a week

*   Results: F

It is hard to do all my habits. I definitely get on a roll one week, then I'll go on vacation or have people over and the next week I relax on my habits.

I only completely filled about 1 ring a week.

### Go To A Tech Meetup

*   Results: F

I looked at a few but did not end up going to a tech meetup.

# What else got done last month?

As you can see I didn't achieve much of my goals for August. I ended up having a bit too much fun, but I think that's what the summer is for. I'll be hunkering down more the next few months.

*   I went to Belgium for this mad festival in Liege. They have a funeral for a ham bone, everyone is dressed up for mock mourning, and they have celery. Really fun weekend with some great beer, food, and pastries.

*   My cousin and brothers came over to Berlin. It was also my birthday, so another year older. Had a really good time catching up with them, but was tired for the next few days after from the binge drinking.

*   Caught up with a lot of friends.

*   I bought a beautiful, pink Fender Bronco Bass My first Bass ever and I'm excited to stick it on some tunes.

*   I played a gig in Schokoladen with Kitty Solaris. Lots of the mates came out, we had a fiasco with our drummer. He told us he was coming for months, then pulled out last second. Luckily. my other friend who's a drummer helped us out. I think we'll be kicking the first drummer out of the band.

*   We released a new music video as CORP. [It came out pretty good!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3wnyxrT5c)

*   Lot's of work at my main job, but not much to report back about. I do enjoy the work, but it doesn't cross over with my personal goals so much.

# Lessons Learned?

*   Not much goals get done in the summer

*   Living out by the beach in a small town allows for much more time & headspace, I could use more of it that what I get in Berlin

*   I need to get more forced alone time in the countryside to work on my art/businesses.

*   I should delegate mixing and mastering duties.

# What are my goals for next month?

> You can’t connect the dots going forward, only back.
>
> Steve Jobs

*Make sure these goals trend the dots towards my goal, being in front of the right people, focusing time where it matters, etc.*

*   Close down SkinTheory

*   Start Marketing ExpatPho.net and Finish dev work

*   Go to a tech meetup

*   Release Chlorine Videos

*   Get youtube ads for new CORP. video and reach out to some labels
