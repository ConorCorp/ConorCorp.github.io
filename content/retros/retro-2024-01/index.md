# How did I do with last month’s goals?

- **[SkinTheory](https://skintheory.app/):** Finish SkinTheory address change
    - Result: C
    
    Didn’t finish but did get most of it done. Hopefully will finish this week. Found out that it is basically related to the tax return, so I’m completing that. 
    
- **[ExpatPhone](https://mailchi.mp/4672819a238d/expat-phone):** Deploy [ExpatPho.net](http://ExpatPho.net) and get it to test users.
    - Result: A+
    
    I actually released [expatpho.net](http://expatpho.net) and had a few users pay for it. I also learned some lessons talking to your first beta users and also how shitty the APIs for numbers are that I’m working with. I’ve slowed down a bit on the development of Expatpho.net, mainly because I hate the problem I have to solve next: Looking for a better US phone number provider.
    
- **[MyGroove](https://mygroove.app/):** Start freelancing with MyGroove.
    - Result: A+
    
    I’ve started freelancing with mygroove which takes up a good bit of my time now. It’s been a really cool project though, augmenting the database for a new feature. So I’m learning a lot and getting paid well. I’ve had some other interviews with startups in the meantime, kind of randomly. And now have to decide how I can move forward.
    
- **[CORP](https://corp.band/).:** Send out some festival applications to ireland.
    - Result: N/A
    
    Rory is going to handle this.
    

# What else got done last month?

- House warming party - Basically fully moved into Fhain now, really took like 6 months from start of finding a house to moving in and furnishing it all from Kleinenzeigen. Had our first house warming party to celebrate which went really well.
- Dry January - We completed dry January together without much issues. My learnings:
    - It’s not that hard to do in the winter, sometimes you leave parties earlier and talking is a bit less fun.
    - Good for working on project and great maintaining a sleep schedule, expecially though the weekend.
    - Some nonalcoholic beers are grand (Flensburger, Franziskaner) some are shit (Becks)
    - Good excuse to get out of stuff if you wanna work on projects
    - Drinking really makes nightlife, otherwise not as fun
    - A lot of our friends broke down and drank
- Played a battle of the bands - Really not into battle of the bands, was a fun night, and interesting to try out, but its pretty cringey
- Recorded some new songs with CORP. which went really well without the click track
- Sorted out all my freelancing shit, banks, taxes etc. It was a lot of work and its really hard to get a bank as an American abroad.

# Lessons Learned?

- Non drinking lessons outlined above
- Building something like [expatpho.net](http://expatpho.net) is very annoying due to sms limitations. Next project would be nice to know if it will 100% work from the get go.
- Moving takes like 6 months if unfurnished.
- String guitars by winding the string over the end, not under

# What are my goals for next month?

“You can’t connect the dots going forward, only back” *- Make sure these goals trend the dots towards my goal, being in front of the right people, focusing time where it matters, etc.*

- Sort out my gym situation, I’m not working out enough
- Decide if I’ll join Formly and move that process forward
- Book Japan holiday
- Learn more about US sms numbers and providers, so I can fix service. Or just implement Europe.
- Finish all taxes

# What are my 2023 (year) goals?

1. 🔴 Kill SkinTheory or get it off my mind completely.
2. 🔴 Build 3 startup projects, and get faster and more publicity with each. Get atleast 1 to €100 MRR.
3. 🟡 Support myself with a cool job or through freelancing.
4. 🟡 Keep myself networked in the startup/engineering scene.
5. 🔴 Get to the next level with CORP. Get on a label or manager that supports bigger bands or gets more publicity.

# What are my lifetime goals?

1. Run my own business that allows me to: support myself, be relaxed, be innovative, love my work, travel.
2. Backpack for 6 months through Asia.
3. Have 100,000 fans of my music.
4. Be relaxed and be excited to wake up to my life every day.
