Planned for this, but wasn't able to get much done between being in the US, catching up with friends, and being in Ireland for Xmas.

# How did I do with last month's goals?

## Music - [Solo Project](www.linktr.ee/se.corp) | [Band Project](www.corp.band)

### Plan (Marketing / Performance) for Berghain release show 
- Result: C+

Hashed out the basic idea for the performance with Josh but I need to really set the performance stuff in stone. Marketing has been pretty minimal.

### Finish 1 SE.Corp song
- Result: D+

Did some work on 143, rerecorded the guitar parts because I just wasn't happy with how it sounded. I basically started from scratch again.

It demoralized me a bit, but once I got into it, I was actually happy out just playing straight into the computer.

I still need to get down how I want to transfer work from my Rhythm Circuit to push.

## Personal
### Book a snowboarding holiday
- Result: F

Think this will just be a no this year. I'm a bit vacationed out rn. This is a good thing I guess, means I've probably a decent W/L balance. 

Feb might be nice though, but maybe its too late to book.

### Finish booking Ireland
- Result: A+

# What else got done last month?
- End of USA trip (see last post)
- Ireland for 2 weeks over xmas, and celebrating my mother's 60th.
- Got my girlfriend her presents

# Lessons Learned?
- Thoughts on the USA after my recent trip
  - way better than Europe for cheap & good quality clothes
  - it's way more dressed down. People in pjs in public.
  - the amount of chain stores is actually mind blowing and kind of sad
  - americans are happy out to chat. They are enjoyably unassuming.
  - the inflation has gotten crazy there.
- Rent is a form of income, while owning an asset in-between. Duhhh.

# Content Consumed
Just for fun, some content I consumed and have thoughts on.

- The Last Duel - Movie - Great Movie on multiple perspectives in France in the Middle Ages.
- The Boy And The Heron - Movie - Slow but thoughtful Myizaki movie.
- A Few Good Men - Movie - Fine movie, probably more potent during the Bush era, but a bit light for me as far as courtroom movies go.
- Doubt - Movie - Meryl Strep is just quite an actor. Enjoyably feminist movie against the catholic church.

# What are my goals for next month?

> You canâ€™t connect the dots going forward, only back.
> 
>Steve Jobs
> 
> *Make sure these goals trend the dots towards my goal, being in front of the right people, focusing time where it matters, etc.*
