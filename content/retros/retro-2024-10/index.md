October was interesting. I actually got the bulk of my goals completed within the first 2 weeks. But I'm tired of seeing people and parties. I didn't get a lot of time for head space or extra curricular work. I've also been sick for like 3 weeks.

# How did I do with last month's goals?

## Work
None
## Music - [Solo Project](www.linktr.ee/se.corp) | [Band Project](www.corp.band)
### Post rest of TikToks/Reels
- Result: A

I posted some more of the tiktoks/reels. They were kind of losing traction though.

Posting results:
- Tiktok
  - My tiktoks don't work in Germany, get like a few bits of interest. I tried posting one through my VPN in the States and that seemed to push a bit more. Gonna try that again with my next one.
- Reels
  - They've been getting less traction, really its mostly friends. Might be nice to try a new account.

I've 2 things to try here next:
1. Make a fancier reel, like my first vision. Putting some more clips onto my vibey videos.
2. Make a new reels account and see if that gets more random viewers.

### Reach out to some labels about my new song
- Result: B

I did a little bit of this but not much. Didn't really get much bites either. Probably should push it more.

### Finish a new SE.CORP song (unmastered)
- Results: C

Didn't really get much time for this, but I'm close to finishing 2!

## Side Projects
### Market Expatpho.net so I can close it off if need be
- Result: A

This project has failed and I am done with it. Awesome! I am free!

I've actually got use out of this product for myself, which is funny. But due to the fact that the virtual numbers are so sketchy, I do
not feel like continuing or actually trying to get in front of the niche. Let's begin my next project!

### Liquidate SkinTheory C Corp.
- Result: B

I've found a lawyer/accountant on Upwork that is helping me here. He's doing what he can now and will finish my 2024 tax return later when its available.

He also noticed that I forgot to file a form in my last year's taxes.
It's really not great, I could be penalized for a good bit of money, but hopefully the IRS takes pity on me as it was an honest mistake.

## Personal

### Deal with Capital One credit card
- Results: A

They just gave me one this time.

### Book Ireland/NYC
- Results: A

Did it.

### Call Penndot for driver's license
- Results: A

Gonna have to do this in person.

# What else got done last month?
- Promoted and played a gig: Sludgefest V
- Made merch for my band, CORP.
- Lots of drinking, my brother came up as well
- Went to 4 shows in 1 week: Video Age, Interpol, STRFKR, Tea Eater
- My 5th Anniversary with Laura ❤️
- Voted from abroad

# Lessons Learned?
- People will come to a show with 5 days notice, but it'll be less.
- Don't do my reels/tiktoks in Germany, location matters
- Leave corporate taxes to the professionals, its painful and easy to make mistakes. Just pay for it.
- Startups are always confident in their next funding round until they're not. VCs always embellish and lie, all you can trust is your numbers.
- No matter what, you will take for granted what you do routinely.

# What are my goals for next month?
> You can’t connect the dots going forward, only back.
> 
>Steve Jobs
> 
> *Make sure these goals trend the dots towards my goal, being in front of the right people, focusing time where it matters, etc.*

- Book Christmas in Ireland
- Book a snowboarding holiday
- Put together a 3 song set to film with SE.CORP
- Finish 1 SE.CORP song (unmastered)
- Choose my next startup side project
