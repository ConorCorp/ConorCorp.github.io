Really was another party month. I haven't had a weekend to myself in June, and may was also being out a lot. Been a bit stressful with all the obligations and I just want to sit inside and work on music / side projects, but the todos keep adding up.

I am having fun though.

# How did I do with last month's goals?

Oops, I forgot to make goals for last month.

# What else got done last month?
- Was rejected by YC for modergator. Was expected but also we held out some hope.
  
  The nice thing about this is that we just put the project down. I think Dom still wants to work on it more, but I was so busy it was nice to just do something, fail, and stop.
- Booked my vacations through switzerland & through scandanavia
- Went to Primavera festival in Barcelona
  
  Festival was a great time. It's a little bit crowded for my liking, and standing on pavement all day is a killer, but was very enjoyable with our mates.
- Went on a stag in Lahinch, did some drinking and surfing.
- Had an offite with Formly in Milan.
  
  Was a nice way to meet the team and was pretty relaxed, although we worked a bit.
- From there, went right to Jack's (from the stag) wedding, and saw some old mates.
- I decided to put a ring on it and I've made preparations. Hold fast for updates 😏

# Lessons Learned?
- Burnout is real when working on too many things, or hanging out with too much friends.
- Setting up a proposal isn't so much work
- I rarely hit 100% of my goals in a week
- It's easier to feel good about your day if you line up a reasonable amount of todos at the start of the day.

# What are my goals for next month?
- Proposal to my lady
- Sort out my housing with my landlord (who wants to sell my place)
- German Taxes
- Plan birthday

> *Make sure these goals trend the dots towards my goal, being in front of the right people, focusing time where it matters, etc.*

# What are my 2024 (year) goals?

1. 🟡 Release/Work on 3 startup projects. Build them faster, throw them out faster.
   - I need to build quickly and release quickly. I need to clear time in my schedule for this.
   - Related lifetime goal: Run my own business.
2. 🟡 Show off 12 items of my work in public. 1 per month atleast.
   - I should build my projects in public. I should have my music out in public more. I should write blog posts. I enjoy the feedback.
   - Related lifetime goal: Run my own business / Have 100k fans of my music.
3. 🟡 Curate and keep to a more regular routine. 6hr side projects. Wake up by 8am.
   - Atleast 6hrs per week on music / side projects.
     - Decide on Sundays what I want to achieve with the week
   - Wake up by 8 regularly and work on my projects in the morning.
     - I do better work in the morning and need to keep this routine. Otherwise I'm tired at night and just watch tv.
   - Reduce my obligations/stress so that I have time to work on projects / music. I feel stressed with all the things I must do. I don't have time for my passions then, and I also can't stop and smell the roses in life.
   - Define what I'll achieve each week.
4. 🔴 Release 4 SE.CORP songs. Set up a repeatable way to get listeners / viewers.
5. 🟡 Develop a better musical ear 
   - I'd like to more readily be able to find notes, tab out songs, and jam over other songs


# What are my lifetime goals?

1. Run my own business that allows me to: support myself, be relaxed, be innovative, love my work, travel.
2. Backpack for 6 months through Asia.
3. Have 100,000 fans of my music.
4. Be relaxed and be excited to wake up to my life every day, and these days are meaningful long-term.
