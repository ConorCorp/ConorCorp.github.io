title: "Monthly Retrospectives"
description: "*July 31, 2022* - I’m going to start doing monthly public  retrospectives based on a format I saw over at Michael Lynch’s blog [*link*](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2022/07/). I often find myself slightly uncomfortable that I’m not “producing” enough or moving towards my goals. I think this will be a good way to stem that feeling and slowly work on meeting more of my goals and acknowledging the work that I put in to myself."
