Intro: I'm almost finished with my language learning app weirdfriends and just thought I'd share some thoughts on what not to do for generating your ai characters to chat with.

1. Don't make an agent
2. Don't provide a random seed
3. Don't create the characters by hand
4. Don't use structured outputs
5. Don't put all your dynamic vars first
