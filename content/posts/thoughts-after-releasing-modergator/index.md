I want to cover 2 things, before I get caught up in thought;
- My feelings releasing [modergator](https://modergator.com) today and getting no new users
- What to do next with modergator


# My feelings releasing a project and getting no users
It sucks. And its basically the worst outcome. And its what I expected to happen.

Our marketing plan was an after thought:
- Make a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1j9fpmh/modergator_an_api_for_small_dev_teams_to_moderate/) on Reddit
- Make a [post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/modergator-an-api-for-small-dev-teams-to-moderate-their-communities-5baff508f1) on indie hackers
- Make a [post](https://x.com/modergator/status/1899826734205116828) on twitter

And the results, of course, are **nothing**. Maybe 10 people came to our site.

Even though I 100% expected this, it still sucks.

It leaves me with a feeling of what to build next? I guess let's drop the heading in here.

# What To Do Next With Modergator

I am feeling that some internal learning has happened here and I want to put it into words.

We built something for 2 months, and in the end, no one cared to use it. Of course it was barely a release, 2.5 posts, but I also felt the post headlines didn't really make a splash.

I am tempted to next build things that make the product easier to use, but I'm realizing that that's a "later in the funnel" problem. **I can't even get people to click on my links.**

I need to build something, even if its not super streamlined at the start, that 
# GRABS FUCKING HEADLINES.

_Modergator isn't a simple content moderation api,_

# Modergator is the API that moderates all your content and learns from what it moderates so that you're dinky little dev team doesn't need to hire anyone.

I think this is a mistake I've been making, I see the vision, but don't work on that right away. I work on the smaller low hanging fruits first, which aren't exciting and don't bring new users in. 

That's why [SkinTheory](https://skintheory.app) took so long to develop and never became the cool, _Solve your own acne with your own data_, dream I wanted for it. 

I need to build the pure vision, the exciting stuff that gets people in the door, even if its a bit jank.

My next experiment:
##  Build for the headline that excites people
