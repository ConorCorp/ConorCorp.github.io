## 1. External validation for a new idea
At the start of a project, I'm not sure if only I have the problem I want to solve.

The more emails that join my wait list, the more excited people are about solving the problem.

I try to be super straight up about who my product is for on the landing page. I also try to scope down the communicated project features as much as possible.

I want high quality leads who will convert on launch. 

If I use rosy language, or promise the world, I'll get a load of lukewarm leads. This will bless me with some lovely signaling to work on the idea for months before no one converts.


## 2. Having an audience for release
I really don't like writing emails. 

I don't really like to do "marketing" tasks in general. 

I just want to code.

The issue is if I don't talk to anyone about the project, when I finally post my EXCITING PROJECT RELEASE POST YAYYYY ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰, I'll get 0 upvotes. Then my project is doomed to being a "resume builder".

Now, if I just put up a dinky little wait list landing page and make some Build In Public posts on Reddit/HN/Indie Hackers, I'll slowly get some supporters.

These supporters actually are excited for my product, how it's made, and its release. I probably won't need to worry then about how viral the release post goes.

These Build In Public posts are a kind of marketing, but I enjoy writing them. They're more like writing in a diary and when I receive a positive comment, it completely excites me and pushes me to work on the project.
