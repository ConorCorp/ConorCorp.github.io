Today I built a wait list landing page for a [new project](modergator.com) of mine.

I did it in around 2 hr 55 min. This is a PB for me. 

I could definitely have done it faster, but with the trade offs I wanted, I am quite happy. 

## The Strategy
*Note: I'm not affiliated with the brands mentioned.*

### 1. Audit current state of drag-and-drop website builders
Time: 45 min | Cost: $0
- I really wanted to find one but couldn't find anything that felt slick and cheap out of the box for a developer tool.
- I still don't enjoy wordpress.
- I will use [Webflow](www.webflow.com) for the landing page if I get big enough, due to the sheer value of quick landing page iteration, but I cannot will myself to pay $18 /month rn.

### 2. Find an html/tailwind template
Time: 20 min | Cost: $0
 - I found [this cute 5 y/o tailwind template](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Rainblur-Landing-Page) from [tailwindtoolbox](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/).
 - I can work really fast in tailwind, and just wanted some static html site so I didn't lock myself into any engineering decisions and could host it on a CDN.

### 3. Customize the template
Time: 1 hr | Cost: $0
- Haven't done much pure HTML in a while, makes you realize me nice components are.
- I wanted to have a code snippet hero image and found this [neat little web app](https://carbon.now.sh/).
- [Another nice web app](https://emoji.aranja.com/) to get an emoji as a png for my temporary logo.
- I added a little extra to the landing page with the planned features.

### 4. Buy a domain
Time: 15 min | Cost: $10.16
- I went with [PorkBun](https://porkbun.com/), which is my first time using them. They're really neat and dev friendly. I probably will stick with them now over Namecheap. 
- They have a free email forwarder built in, which is super nice. It's great for signing up for services that you'll want to use for the new project.
- Note: Found a $1 dollar coupon code: `VIKAS` for .com domains. Probably not worth the time looking for it, but whatever. 

### 5. Sign up / Configure an email tool
Time: 15 min | Cost: $0
- Signed up to [EmailOctopus](www.emailoctopus.com) with new custom domain email address.
- I knew I'd use EmailOctopus, they're great for indie hackers, nice free tier, and really simple.
- Generated a form to collect emails into the list

### 6. Add email form to HTML & Test email sign up
Time: 5 min | Cost: $0

### 7. Deploy Webpage
Time: 15 min | Cost: $0
- I used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), where I host this website already.
- Super easy to post a static site and point a custom domain at it.
- PorkBun can actually autofill Github's DNS into its DNS settings, which was so cool. Saved me some time.
- Let's ignore the few minutes I waited for DNS propagation and my SSL cert loading.


## Results
### Time Spent: 
2 hrs 55 min

### Cost: 
$10.16

### Deliverables:
- My own website
- Customizable code / theme
- Functioning Email list
- No hosting / email fees

### Thoughts
This would be easy to speed up if repeated. I could get it down to 1 hr if I did an exact copy with a different idea.

Here's some some more thoughts on why I [like using wait lists](/posts/why-wait-lists).
