I’ve been just a bit too silent for too long on this blog.

The constant waves of I-should-be-writing guilt finally flung me far enough below the surf that drastic measures were required to resurface: I added a headless CMS to my static website.



## Friction: Git Pages + Hugo flow

I could foresee 0 issues, as I frolicked into the [v1 build](https://c0n0.com/posts/website-in-10-minutes-for-programmers/) of this blog.

I laid my eyes upon the stunningly understandable markdown files that make up Hugo and grew excited with how easy & fun it’d be to write, just the same way that I’d wrote READMEs. I could then host it for free on my own GitHub page, No server needed, no monthly fees, no domain, and the content is all mine baby.
