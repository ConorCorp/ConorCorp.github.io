Yesterday, I went for a bike ride.
\
\
I thought about the beach. I thought about how Iâ€™d never been to Sicily.
\
\
I mentioned this Sicilian beach thought to my girlfriend later.
\
\
My girlfriend pondered the beach and Sicily.
\
\
She liked the thought and we made plans to go to Sicily this summer. 
\
\
Because I went on a bike ride today and forgot to charge my headphones, my passing thoughts became actions.
\
\
**Actions and formulated opinions don't need to come from structured, purposeful thinking sessions.** \
My passing thoughts can become plans. Plans resulting in me doing something in my life.
\
\
If I spend all my in-between time constantly distracting myself with Youtube, podcasts, etc., I will have regularly: 
\
\
dwelled less on my desires, 
\
formulating less opinions, 
\
inspiring less action,
\
resulting in more Youtube on the couch.
