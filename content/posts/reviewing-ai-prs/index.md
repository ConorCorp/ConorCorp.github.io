When you give me a PR to review, it should be complete and tested by YOU. 

You should be proud and ready for your work to be shipped right now. I'm just here to double check things.

I should not be:
- the first set of HUMAN eyes to look at your AI slop
- making your code DRY/maintainable because the AI didn't
- cleaning up the style/formatting to fit with the rest of our codebase because the AI didn't

**The Bottom Line**

Clean up your vibecode before sending it. 

It's not my job as the reviewer, it's yours.
