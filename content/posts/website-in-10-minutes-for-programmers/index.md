See the website you‚Äôre reading this on? I didn‚Äôt make this in 10 minutes‚Ä¶. But I sure could have if I had this tutorial. So here‚Äôs how you can make your own customizable resume website or blog for free in 2021 using the Hugo framework, a few commands in the terminal, Github Pages to host it.

Skip to [Part 1: Let‚Äôs make a website](#part-1-lets-make-your-website) if you wanna skip my banter üòî


## First off, Why [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)?

**I think it‚Äôs nifty as hell.**  
You basically only need to write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) once its set up.

I‚Äôve made uncountably infinite[^1] websites in my time and it‚Äôs always been a pain to update them, especially if you don‚Äôt always want to code, deal with CSS each time, or some crappy [WYSIWYG editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).

[^1]: Very much countably finite but a shitload of websites nonetheless.

### Hugo basically smashed my 3 requirements:
1. Be easy to set up - *it‚Äôs literally like <5 lines on the command line.* üòå
2. Look sexy, work optimally. - *Has great themes and generates static pages.* ü§©
3. Most importantly: Be easy to update with new content. - *Bye bye Wordpress!* üíÄ

To expand on 3, I do love me a bit of coding. I do it all the time. But this website is for writing and expressing my thoughts. Not coding. I have enough of that at my day job. So any extra code I need to write or dumb sFTP process I have to do to put out new content is bad.

Also, writing in markdown with [Bear Notes](https://www.bear.app) and doing 3 commands to publish is incredibly liberating when compared to something like Wordpress. It also has some really cool out of the box features like [comments](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/), [search](https://gohugo.io/tools/search/), [code syntax hightlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/), [translations](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/), and [google analytics support](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/).

## Why should you make a blog (or resume website)?
The reason for a resume website is self-explanatory:  
**It gives you clout.**

But so does writing! And its also fun! Even if you don‚Äôt enjoy writing, it‚Äôs an incredible skill for immortalizing yourself in history. Or minus the hyperbole, for crafting convincing emails to your very human stakeholders. They can usually be swayed by a little loquacious liturgy of poignant prose.

Back on the clout thing; have you ever seen a TED or DEFCON talk? We often look at these people like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be smart enough to give a talk like this.‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an industry expert, I don‚Äôt even know how I would start doing something like that.‚Äù


The thing is, they are just normal people like you and I with some better publicity.

Starting a blog on what you already know is a solid way to begin developing your public persona, but even if that‚Äôs not your cup of tea, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre up for an interview at a FAANG company: *It will make you look really REALLY good*.

Readers will tend to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume your knowledge on a subject goes very deep. You‚Äôre something of an SME as the cool kids might say. You may not be[^2], but it‚Äôs just a serendipitous thing about publishing content. Although, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy as you learn everything possible to spite your commenters who are flaming the living crap out of you. üî•

Tl;Dr: Try some writing! üòé

# Part 1: Let‚Äôs make your website

This is basically my curated summary on the [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) paired with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

### Requirements
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or  [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

&nbsp;  
## 1. Pop open the terminal and install Hugo

I use a Mac with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Here‚Äôs Hugo‚Äôs [install docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) for more options.

```bash
# Mac & Linux
brew install hugo

# Windows
choco install hugo -confirm  # Normal, no SCSS

# Verify it says something like "Hugo Static Site Generator v0.80.0/..."
hugo version
```

&nbsp;  
## 2. Choose a theme

This a really exciting piece of Hugo. The themes here are beautiful, minimal, and beautifully minimal. You just pick one and can configure a few params and have a working website. You can customize it more later too!

Find a theme here: [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/) . I chose the beautifully minimal [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) by [Aditya Telange](https://twitter.com/adityatelange) and will be using that for this tutorial.

&nbsp;  
## 3. Generate your website
Generate your generic Hugo website named `quickstart` or any name you choose.
```bash
# if you want to use the PaperMod theme I'm using,
# we generate the Hugo template with a yaml config
hugo new site quickstart -f yml

# or for a normal site with a toml config
hugo new site quickstart
```
_Note: If you didn‚Äôt choose PaperMod as your theme, you may need to run a different command. Check out their documentation, it will likely be one of the 2 commands above._

&nbsp;  
## 4. Add chosen theme to your your website
Clone the chosen theme into your project and add it in the `config.yml`.
For the `PaperMod` theme:
```bash
cd quickstart
git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1
echo theme: \"PaperMod\" >> config.yml
```

&nbsp;  
## 5. Add your first content

*Quoted from [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)*

> You can manually create content files (for example as `content/<CATEGORY>/<FILE>.<FORMAT>`) and provide metadata in them, however you can use the `new` command to do a few things for you (like add `title` and `date`):

```bash
hugo new posts/hello-word.md
```
&nbsp;  
Edit the newly created content file at `content/posts/hello-word.md` in a text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The `hello-word.md` will look something like this, add in some content!
```markdown
---
<!-- Front loaded content Hugo uses to define post -->
title: "My First Post"
date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00
draft: true
---

<!-- Write your markdown here -->

# Hello, World!
```
> Drafts do not get deployed; once you finish a post, update the header of the post to say `draft: false`.

&nbsp;  
## 6. Start the Hugo server
Run your local Hugo server for development and writing articles. You're website should be alive. üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```bash
# Runs a local server and the `-D` arg which builds drafts
hugo server -D
```
Open [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) and see your beautiful creation üéâ

&nbsp;  
## 7. Customize Your Theme

The `config.yml` in the root dir is your life blood.

It‚Äôs how you customize your website. While the Hugo server is running, any change you make to the `config.yaml` or in a post your are writing will update on save in your browser. Sweet üç≠

### Take a look at these sources below on how to augment your theme:
- [PaperMod Docs](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) (Contains demo of site, demo config.yml, and a list of the features)
- [My config.yml (for this website)](https://github.com/ConorCorp/ConorCorp.github.io/blob/main/config.yml)
- [Theme Docs | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/)
- The GitHub for whichever theme you chose.

&nbsp;  
## 8. Build the website for production
Simply builds and minifies the production website into the `public/` directory. Also moves all your static `assets/` (extra css, js, and images) into `public/`.
```bash
hugo
```

&nbsp;  
## Easy as ü•ß

You have an optimized, static website! You could just stick contents of the `public` folder up on a web server right now and be done with it. That‚Äôs cool and all but it doesn‚Äôt meet the bar I set for [requirement 3](#hugo-basically-smashed-my-3-requirements): *‚ÄúBe easy to update with new content‚Äù*.

Imagine if we could just write our new post, build the new site with the `hugo` command, and then publish the website live with one push to Github? It‚Äôs actually not too hard and its free! You also get SSL thrown in there too!

# Part 2: Hosting Your Hugo Site On GitHub Pages

Now I'll be summarizing the [Hugo Github Pages Docs](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and [Github Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#user--organization-pages).


## GitHub Pages

Github allows you to make 2 kinds of Github Pages projects.

- User/Organization Pages (`https://<USERNAME|ORGANIZATION>.github.io/)`
- Project Pages (`https://<USERNAME|ORGANIZATION>.github.io/<PROJECT>/`)

We‚Äôre going to do a normal user page like the one your currently on.

&nbsp;  
## 1. Create your Website repo on GitHub

Go to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account in the browser. Create a new repository for your website with the name `<username>.github.io`. `username` is your Github username. You can add a `README.md` to the repo on creation.  If you need help: [Github Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

*Note: You can skip steps 2 and 3 if you'd prefer to `git init` your current Hugo site repo and point it to your `<username>.github.io` remote.*

&nbsp;  
## 2. Clone the `<username>.github.io` repo locally
{{< figure src="images/clone-github.png" width="600px" caption="Example of the created GitHub repo and url to clone it." >}}

Pull the repo down locally with SSH or HTTPS link. Use HTTPS if you haven't set up SSH.
```base
git clone git@github.com:<username>/<username>.github.io.git
```

&nbsp;  
## 3. Copy your whole Hugo website into this repo
Copy the contents of your `quickstart` (or custom website name) folder into your newly cloned repo.
```bash
cp -r quickstart/* <path-to-cloned-repo>
# cp -r quickstart/* ConorCorp.github.io
```

&nbsp;  
## 4. Change the `config.yml` to make new builds in `docs/`
Github Pages only allows you to host your website from 1 of 2 directories in your repo. As of this writing they are: `/` (root) or `/docs`.


We want to make sure that our visitors are only served the (optimized) production website code. Although, it'd be much cleaner if we saved both our development code and production website code in the same source-controlled repo.

So, we will now update the Hugo config to build all of our production code only in the `/docs` folder and tell Github only to host that folder. First, let's clean up.
```bash
cd <path-to-cloned-repo>
# Remove default publishdir folder, we're using `docs/` now.
rm -r public
```
&nbsp;  
In the `config.yaml`, update:
* `baseURL` to `http://<username>.github.io/`
* `publishdir` to `docs`

A basic `config.yml` may now look like:
```markdown
baseURL: http://conorcorp.github.io/
languageCode: en-us
title: Conor Lamb
theme: "PaperMod"
publishdir: docs
```

&nbsp;  
## 5. Build your website for production.

Build your production website and push our code to our online repo.
```bash
hugo

git add .
git commit -m "update: publish dir"
git push origin main
```

&nbsp;  
## 6. Update GitHub Pages to host the `docs/` dir.
{{< figure src="images/publish-github-pages.png" width="400px" caption="Example of published Github Pages and docs config." >}}
1. From GitHub in your browser, go to the `<username>.github.io` repo.
2. Go to `settings -> pages`.
3. Update `Source` to point to `/docs` dir on the `main` branch.
4. Your site should be published, now go to `<username>.github.io` in the browser.
    * [Note](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site): If your site has not published automatically, make sure someone with admin permissions and a verified email address has pushed to the publishing source. 

&nbsp;  
# Done! üéä

You now have a public, static[^3] website, built on Hugo and hosted for free with Github Pages! Its super easy to update too! Its ~5 commands including the `git` stuff. Feel free to add the code below to you‚Äôre `README.md` for your future updates.

[^3]: `void main(String[] args)`. First thing I memorized coding. It's a reflex at this point when `public static` show up together.

```bash
hugo server -D  # Local development with drafts
hugo new posts/name-of-post.md # Add new post
# make sure "env: production" in config.yml for PaperMod
hugo # Builds in /docs directory
# add and push to git for auto build within 1 min give or take
```
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
*P.S If you'd like cut out 1 step in this process, you can add a [Github Action to auto build and deploy production](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) on commits. Imagine all the time you'll save by not typing in `hugo` to build production as well???!!!*
