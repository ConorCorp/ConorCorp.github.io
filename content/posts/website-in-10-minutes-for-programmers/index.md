See the website you‚Äôre reading this on? I didn‚Äôt make this in 10 minutes‚Ä¶. But I sure could have if I had this tutorial. So here‚Äôs how you can make your own customizable resume website or blog for free in 2021 using the Hugo framework, a few commands in the terminal, Github Pages to host it.

Skip to [Part 1: Let‚Äôs make a website](#part-1-lets-make-your-website) if you wanna skip my banter üòî

## First off, Why [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)?

**I think it‚Äôs nifty as hell.**  
You basically only need to write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) once its set up.

I‚Äôve made uncountably infinite[^1] websites in my time and it‚Äôs always been a pain to update them, especially if you don‚Äôt always want to code, deal with CSS each time, or some crappy [WYSIWYG editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).

[^1]: Very much countably finite but a shitload of websites nonetheless.

### Hugo basically smashed my 3 requirements:
1. Be easy to set up - *it‚Äôs literally like <5 lines on the command line.* üòå
2. Look sexy, work optimally. - *Has great themes and generates static pages.* ü§©
3. Most importantly: Be easy to update with new content. - *Bye bye Wordpress!* üíÄ

To expand on 3, I do love me a bit of coding. I do it all the time. But this website is for writing and expressing my thoughts. Not coding. I have enough of that at my day job. So any extra code I need to write or dumb sFTP process I have to do to put out new content is bad.

Also, writing in markdown with [Bear Notes](www.bear.app) and doing 3 commands to publish is incredibly liberating when compared to something like Wordpress. It also has some really cool out of the box features like [comments](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/), [search](https://gohugo.io/tools/search/), [code syntax hightlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/), [translations](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/), and [google analytics support](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/).

## Why should you make a blog (or resume website)?
The reason for a resume website is self-explanatory:  
**It gives you clout.**

But so does writing! And its also fun! Even if you don‚Äôt enjoy writing, it‚Äôs an incredible skill for immortalizing yourself in history. Or minus the hyperbole, for crafting convincing emails to your very human stakeholders. They can usually be swayed by a little loquacious liturgy of poignant prose.

Back on the clout thing; have you ever seen a TED or DEFCON talk? We often look at these people like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be smart enough to give a talk like this.‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an industry expert, I don‚Äôt even know how I would start doing something like that.‚Äù


The thing is, they are just normal people like you and I with some better publicity.

Starting a blog on what you already know is a solid way to begin developing your public persona, but even if that‚Äôs not your cup of tea, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre up for an interview at a FAANG company: *It will make you look really REALLY good*.

Readers will tend to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume your knowledge on a subject goes very deep. You‚Äôre something of an SME as the cool kids might say. You may not be[^2], but it‚Äôs just a serendipitous thing about publishing content. Although, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy as you learn everything possible to spite your commenters who are flaming the living crap out of you. üî•

Tl;Dr: Try some writing! üòé

# Part 1: Let‚Äôs make your website.

This is basically my curated summary on the [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) paired with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

### Requirements
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or  [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)


### 1. Pop open the terminal and install Hugo.

I use a Mac with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Here‚Äôs Hugo‚Äôs [install docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) for more options.

```bash
# Mac & Linux
brew install hugo

# Windows
choco install hugo -confirm  # Normal, no SCSS

# Verify it says something like "Hugo Static Site Generator v0.80.0/..."
hugo version
```

## 2. Choose a theme.

This a really exciting piece of Hugo. The themes here are beautiful, minimal, and beautifully minimal. You just pick one and can configure a few params and have a working website. You can customize it more later too!

Find a theme here: [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/) . I chose the beautifully minimal [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) by [Aditya Telange](adityatelange.in) and will be using that for this tutorial.

## 3. Generate your website.

```bash
# if you want to use the PaperMod theme I'm using,
# we generate the Hugo template with a yaml config
hugo new site quickstart -f yml

# or for a normal site with a toml config
hugo new site quickstart
```

This will generate your generic Hugo website named `quickstart`. Call it what you like.

_Note: If you didn‚Äôt choose PaperMod as your theme, you may need to run a different command. Check out their documentation, tt will likely be one of the 2 commands above._

## 4. Add your chosen website theme.
```bash
# For the PaperMod theme
cd quickstart
git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1
echo theme: \"PaperMod\" >> config.yml
```
Clone the chosen theme into your project and add it in the `config.yml`. Again, check the docs of your theme on how to install it if not using PaperMod.

## 5. Add your first content!

*Quoted from [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)*

> You can manually create content files (for example as `content/<CATEGORY>/<FILE>.<FORMAT>`) and provide metadata in them, however you can use the `new` command to do a few things for you (like add `title` and `date`):

```bash
hugo new posts/hello-word.md
```

Edit the newly created content file at `content/posts/hello-word.md` if you want, it will start with something like this:

```markdown
---
<!-- Front loaded content Hugo uses to define post -->
title: "My First Post"
date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00
draft: true <!-- flip  to `false` when ready to publish -->
---

<!-- Write your markdown here -->

# Hello, World!
```

> Drafts do not get deployed; once you finish a post, update the header of the post to say `draft: false`.

## 6. Start the Hugo Server
```bash
# Runs a local server and the `-D` arg builds drafts
# Note: drafts aren't built in production by default, only in development
hugo server -D

# Open http://localhost:1313/ and see your beautiful creation üéâ
```
Run your local Hugo server for development and writing articles. You're website should be alive. üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## 7. Customize Your Theme

The `config.yml` in the root dir is your life blood.

It‚Äôs how you augment your site to look how you want it to look. Any change you make to the `config.yaml` or in a post will automatically update in your browser while the local Hugo server is running. Sweet üç≠

**Take a look at these sources below on how to augment your theme:**
- [PaperMod Docs](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) (Contains demo of site, demo config.yml, and a list of the features)
- [My config.yml (for this website)](https://github.com/ConorCorp/ConorCorp.github.io/blob/main/config.yml)
- [Theme Docs | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/)
- The GitHub for whichever theme you chose.

## 8. Build production website
```bash
hugo # Builds and minifies content into public/ dir
```
Simply builds the static pages and assets that will be your production website. Also moves all your static `assets/` like css, js, and images into the `public/` folder.

## Simple, ehh?!

You have an optimized static website! You could just stick contents of the `public` folder up on a web server right now and be done with it. That‚Äôs cool and all but it doesn‚Äôt meet the bar I set for (requirement 3)[#hugo-basically-smashed-my-3-requirements]: ‚ÄúBe easy to update with new content‚Äù.

Imagine if we could just write our new post, build the new site with the `hugo` command, and then publish the website live by pushing that update to GitHub? It‚Äôs actually not too hard and its free! You also get SSL thrown in there too!

# Part 2: Hosting Your Static Site On GitHub Pages.

Now I'll be summarizing the [Hugo Github Pages Docs](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and [Github Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#user--organization-pages).

### GitHub Pages

Github allows you to make 2 kinds of Github Pages projects.

- User/Organization Pages (`https://<USERNAME|ORGANIZATION>.github.io/)`
- Project Pages (`https://<USERNAME|ORGANIZATION>.github.io/<PROJECT>/`)

We‚Äôre going to do a normal user page like the one your currently on.

### 1. Create your Website repo on GitHub.

On [GitHub](https://github.com/) in the browser, create a new repository for your website with the name `<username>.github.io`. You can add a `README.md` if you like.  

[Github Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

### 2. Clone that repo locally.
{{< figure src="images/clone-github.png" width="600px" caption="Example of the created GitHub repo and url to clone it." >}}

Pull the repo down locally with SSH or HTTPS.
```base
git clone git@github.com:<username>.github.io.git
```

### 3. Copy your Hugo site contents to this repo.
```bash
cp -r quickstart/* <path-to-cloned-repo>
```
Copy the contents of your `quickstart` (or whatever name you chose for your website) folder into your newly cloned repo.

### 4. Change the `config.yml` in your new repo to create new builds in `docs/`
```bash
cd <path-to-cloned-repo>

# Add `publishdir: docs` to your `config.yml`
rm -r public # Remove unnecessary old build folder
hugo # Build in `docs`

git add .
git commit -m "update: publish dir"
git push origin main
```
Github pages only allows you to host your website from 1 of 2 directories in your repo. As of this writing they are: `/` (root) or `/docs` . Ideally, we‚Äôd like to keep our code and build in the same source-controlled repository but we don‚Äôt want our users to be served our source code. They should only get the generated production code from the `hugo` command. So we have to make it so production builds are created in `docs/` and GitHub pages only serves `docs/`. Then we push our code to our online repo.

### 5. Update GitHub Pages to only host the `docs/` dir.
{{< figure src="images/publish-github-pages.png" width="400px" caption="Example of published Github Pages and docs config." >}}
1. From GitHub in your browser, go to the `<username>.github.io` repo.
2. Go to `settings -> pages`.
3. Update `Source` to point to `/docs` dir on the `main` branch.
4. Publish your site and go to `<username>.github.io` in the browser.

# Done! üéä

You now have a public, static[^3] website, built on Hugo and hosted for free with Github Pages! Its super easy to update too! Its ~5 commands including the `git` stuff. Feel free to add the code below to you‚Äôre `README.md` for your future updates.

[^3]: `void main(String[] args)`. First thing I memorized coding. It's a reflex at this point when `public static` show up together.

```bash
hugo server -D  # Local development with drafts
hugo new posts/name-of-post.md # Add new post
# make sure "env: production" in config.yml for PaperMod
hugo # Builds in /docs directory
# add and push to git for auto build within 1 min give or take
```
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
*P.S If you'd like cut out 1 step in this process, you can add a [Github Action to auto build and deploy production](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) on commits. Imagine all the time you'll save by not typing in `hugo` to build production as well???!!!*
