      <description>Reviewing pull requests is a pain in the hole, but a necessary one. It is also massive time sync if you&amp;rsquo;re actually doing it right.
Normal PR Process It often looks like this:
Get slack message: ‚Äúpwetty pwease review my PR :3 pr link‚Äù Open in browser, scroll through the code a bit Inner Monologue: ‚ÄúThis looks mostly understandable? Can I can get away without pulling this locally?‚Äù Decide to run it locally Stash current branch&amp;rsquo;s changes (remember that you have a stash saved!</description>

      <title>On Getting Discovered</title>

      <description>I blog sometimes. I publish a good bit of music as well, and yet, no one knows me. This is fine. I happily mosey through life without internet celebrity, but candidly (and probably humanly), it would be nice to get recognition for the things that I make. So how does one get &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo;? Youtube just recommended me this small linux youtuber, who struck me with a Jimmy Neutron style, brain blast on how these algorithms likely work.</description>

      <title>Making A Language Learning Buddy w/ ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://c0n0.com/posts/chat-gpt-buddy/</link>

      <guid>https://c0n0.com/posts/chat-gpt-buddy/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at a quietly frustrating point with my German language learning. It&amp;rsquo;s an uncomfortable expanse within A1-A2 levels where I pick up a myriad of words in a conversation, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not confident enough to say much. The usual solution here is one of brute force. Go make a fool of yourself, often and brazenly, in the wild. Talk to people around you, have awkward-as-hell conversations. But, how can I cash in on the ChatGPT hype that way?</description>

      <description>Scientists keep logbooks for their findings. Why don&amp;rsquo;t computer scientists? A great place to start doing this is for debugging. Debugging sucks enough as is, make it easier on yourself. A logbook will&amp;hellip;
üó∫ Enumerate where you are in the bug fix journey. You&amp;rsquo;ll forget this journey when you pick it up tomorrow, write it down.
üå≥ Keep you rooted to the ground. (Creating an &amp;ldquo;issue stack&amp;rdquo;.) Related to above, it often feels like you&amp;rsquo;re completely lost in the aether when you&amp;rsquo;re 50 opened browser tabs deep into an issue that&amp;rsquo;s not even the same issue anymore, its a sub issue of a sub issue.</description>
