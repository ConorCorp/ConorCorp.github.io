Work None this month!\nMusic Plan for Chlorine Release/Video Result: C+ I have a plan and a format for making a few videos with Josh. I have remixed the song a few more times but I like where it is now.\nI don’t have an exact plan for the release itself, I mean I do for releasing the reels around the song, but not a plan to get some other release buzz. I’ll also still need to decide on if I’ll change my instagram name.\nI think the biggest bottle necks with this slow release cycle have been:\nFinishing the song master I could solve this by either not doing the mixes (€300?) or just doing a basic mix and sending it on for a master right away (€50-100). Not knowing how to get buzz around the song I have to solve this by outreach, but once I get one publication to help with release, I’ll be good. Maybe get some help here. Side Projects Spend more time on projects Result: B- Not the best goal I’ve designed here, there is no specific achievement. Regardless, I have spent around 5+ hours with my friend Conall working on the www.expatpho.net project. He’s new to programming, so it’s been fun to teach him stuff, but it’s also just way more fun to do projects like this with people. It makes me procrastinate less.\nSide tangent: Making music with other people is likely the same feeling, but I also find its something I don’t mind doing on my own. Having more control there is something I like. With the side projects its half about control and half about getting shit done.\nWind down expatpho.net Result: N/A I’ve changed my mind a bit here, as mentioned above, and started working with Conall on www.expatpho.net.\nI think we can get it into a self service mode for fun and just push that and see if it works. It’s pretty low effort from my side and a fun activity with Conall.\nStart winding down SkinTheory Result: C+ I’ve talked with Moé about winding down SkinTheory, but again, I’ve kind of considered keeping it alive. It has great interactions and numbers, and I’ve lots of ideas for it.\nMoé is also cool with me taking back the IP and putting it in my own umbrella entity, and we’d work out some deal for him to do marketing on an affiliate basis.\nI think I’ve a problem letting go of projects I sunk time into.\nPlan next startup Result: D I haven’t really considered it. I’ve been kind of busy with the job, current projects, music, and vacations.\nI really like 2 ideas though:\nThis DIY Audio Tour idea with my brother. Resend for AI video content moderation. I’ve been kind of leaning towards a nice b2b idea, but I think I’d like to be in a business first and have a need, before just building something. The Resend idea is not bad. Could be my first b2b one, but I need to have more time for side projects.\nPersonal Actually fill my habit tracker rings most days Result: B- I filled about half of the days, but this was better than the previous month. Looks like I’m generally better at doing my habits in the beginning of the week and start to slack on and towards the weekend.\nRelease one blog post Result: A+ I released a blog post on doing PRs in the editor! I didn’t really get great reception on it, lot of hate actually. Which isn’t super nice, but hey, I might tweak it and post it again. Fuck the haters.\nGo to a tech meetup Result: C I had some planned but just didn’t feel like it on the night :/\nWhat else got done last month? I went and saw a friend in Glasgow. I went to a nice little movie festival again, Lakeside Festival in Berlin. I’ve done a bunch of backend and database work at Formly.ai. I got 2k in back taxes from 2020! I booked a few vacations, specifically back to the USA. I tried to get a credit card, which is not easy. I played alot of video games with my brothers. Very fun, but a big time sink. I had a big chat with my band: CORP. about my lack of interest in the band lately. It was a tough chat, but I really liked how I explained myself. I said that, I can’t help it, but I just am not having as much fun with the music direction. I basically made that case that its going in a slightly different direction, and I still like it, but I’m enjoying my solo music more rn. Lessons Learned? I should always try to do side projects with someone else. It makes me work more. Working on coding / biz / music projects with people is actually a fun activity in itself. I’d like to spend more time doing projects with a beer on a friday, rather than just having the beer. I am starting to say no to hangouts with friends, and using the excuse that I’m busy on my own projects. I spend to much time on hang outs I don’t want to be at out of social guilt. The 4 day work week with a friday off is a bit dangerous for having 2 party days. What are my goals for next month? You can’t connect the dots going forward, only back.\nSteve Jobs\nMake sure these goals trend the dots towards my goal, being in front of the right people, focusing time where it matters, etc.\nFully Planned Out Release Chlorine Expatpho.net Self Service Plan Finish SkinTheory closing documents Complete My German Taxes Complete Habit Rings 5/7 days a week Go To A Tech Meetup What are my 2024 (year) goals? 🟡 Kill SkinTheory or get it off my mind completely. 🟡 Build 3 startup projects, and get faster and more publicity with each. Get atleast 1 to €100 MRR. 🟢 Support myself with a cool job or through freelancing. 🟡 Keep myself networked in the startup/engineering scene. 🔴 Get to the next level with CORP. Get on a label or manager that supports bigger bands or gets more publicity. What are my lifetime goals? Run my own business that allows me to: support myself, be relaxed, be innovative, love my work, travel. Backpack for 6 months through Asia. Have 100,000 fans of my music. Be relaxed and be excited to wake up to my life every day. ",

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with Moé about winding down SkinTheory, but again, I&rsquo;ve kind of considered keeping it alive. It has great interactions and numbers, and I&rsquo;ve lots of ideas for it.</p>
<p>Moé is also cool with me taking back the IP and putting it in my own umbrella entity, and we&rsquo;d work out some deal for him to do marketing on an affiliate basis.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve a problem letting go of projects I sunk time into.</p>

<li>Result: D</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really considered it. I&rsquo;ve been kind of busy with the job, current projects, music, and vacations.</p>
<p>I really like 2 ideas though:</p>
<ul>
<li>This DIY Audio Tour idea with my brother.</li>
<li>Resend for AI video content moderation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been kind of leaning towards a nice b2b idea, but I think I&rsquo;d like to be in a business first and have a need, before just building something. The Resend idea is not bad. Could be my first b2b one, but I need to have more time for side projects.</p>

<p>I filled about half of the days, but this was better than the previous month. Looks like I&rsquo;m generally better at doing my habits in the beginning of the week and start to slack on and towards the weekend.</p>

<p>I released a blog post on doing <a href="posts/faster-prs/">PRs in the editor</a>! I didn&rsquo;t really get great reception on it, lot of hate actually. Which isn&rsquo;t super nice, but hey, I might tweak it and post it again. Fuck the haters.</p>

<ul>
<li>I went and saw a friend in Glasgow.</li>
<li>I went to a nice little movie festival again, Lakeside Festival in Berlin.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of backend and database work at Formly.ai.</li>
<li>I got 2k in back taxes from 2020!</li>
<li>I booked a few vacations, specifically back to the USA.</li>
<li>I tried to get a credit card, which is not easy.</li>
<li>I played alot of video games with my brothers. Very fun, but a big time sink.</li>
<li>I had a big chat with my band: CORP. about my lack of interest in the band lately. It was a tough chat, but I really liked how I explained myself. I said that, I can&rsquo;t help it, but I just am not having as much fun with the music direction. I basically made that case that its going in a slightly different direction, and I still like it, but I&rsquo;m enjoying my solo music more rn.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lessons-learned">#</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>I should always try to do side projects with someone else. It makes me work more.</li>
<li>Working on coding / biz / music projects with people is actually a fun activity in itself. I&rsquo;d like to spend more time doing projects with a beer on a friday, rather than just having the beer.</li>
<li>I am starting to say no to hangouts with friends, and using the excuse that I&rsquo;m busy on my own projects. I spend to much time on hang outs I don&rsquo;t want to be at out of social guilt.</li>
<li>The 4 day work week with a friday off is a bit dangerous for having 2 party days.</li>
