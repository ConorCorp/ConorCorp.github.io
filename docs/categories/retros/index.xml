      <description>Goals Met: ~70%
Song Of The Month (listen while reading!): Pink Pony Club - Chappell Roan - Pop Last month I was a bit too ambitious in my goal setting. I spent the last week of the month on holiday in the US, so I was unable to work on anything productive there.
Before I left, I ended up being pretty busy as well.
How did I do with last month&amp;rsquo;s goals?</description>

Song Of The Month (listen while reading!): Boy Toy - STRFKR - Synth Pop
October was interesting. I actually got the bulk of my goals completed within the first 2 weeks. But I&amp;rsquo;m tired of seeing people and parties. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a lot of time for head space or extra curricular work. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been sick for like 3 weeks.
