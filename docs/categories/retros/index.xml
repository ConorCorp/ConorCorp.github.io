Song Of The Month (listen while reading!): HOT TO GO! - Chappell Roan - Girl Power Pop
April and May are great months in Berlin. A good portion of the public holidays are crammed into these 2 months. I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely been taking advantage of that, but I probably could have been a bit more productive.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had this strange and chronic anxiousness the last week or 2. It&amp;rsquo;s an anxiousness that I find I&amp;rsquo;m prone to.</description>

Song Of The Month (listen while reading!): Dragonborn - Jeremy Soule - Skyrim Soundtrack

Song Of The Month (listen while reading!): PicarÃ³n - Mexican Indie
Time flies. Each retrospective I&amp;rsquo;ve completed marks a month of my life, I can see in the files here that they are really starting to pile up.
How did I do with last month&amp;rsquo;s goals? Music - Solo Project | Band Project Prepare for the CORP. release show Results: A Our release show went spectacularly. It took up a good bit of my mental space for the first 3 weeks of Jan.</description>

Song Of The Year (listen while reading!): New Tricks - Petite League - Indie Pop
How did I do with last year&amp;rsquo;s goals? ðŸŸ¡Â Kill SkinTheory or get it off my mind completely.
Results: A The wheels are in motion, SkinTheory as an Inc. is officially no more. I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about it much.
SkinTheory the app is still alive, and kind of just sitting there in a holding pattern until I want to come back to it, or apple/google make a change to the app store.</description>

      <description>Goals Met: ~70%
Song Of The Month (listen while reading!): Pink Pony Club - Chappell Roan - Pop Last month I was a bit too ambitious in my goal setting. I spent the last week of the month on holiday in the US, so I was unable to work on anything productive there.
Before I left, I ended up being pretty busy as well.

Song Of The Month (listen while reading!): Boy Toy - STRFKR - Synth Pop
October was interesting. I actually got the bulk of my goals completed within the first 2 weeks. But I&amp;rsquo;m tired of seeing people and parties. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a lot of time for head space or extra curricular work. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been sick for like 3 weeks.
