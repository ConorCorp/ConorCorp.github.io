      <description>When you give me a PR to review, it should be complete and tested by YOU.
You should be proud and ready for your work to be shipped right now. I&amp;rsquo;m just here to double check things.
I should not be:
the first set of HUMAN eyes to look at your AI slop making your code DRY/maintainable because the AI didn&amp;rsquo;t cleaning up the style/formatting to fit with the rest of our codebase because the AI didn&amp;rsquo;t The Bottom Line</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m optimizing my next product for:
An eye popping headline (clicks) As much conversations with users as humanly possible (pmf) Extra credit:
it&amp;rsquo;s launched in a community interested in the topic, so the release post doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like an advertisement </description>

      <description>I want to cover 2 things, before I get caught up in thought;
My feelings releasing modergator today and getting no new users What to do next with modergator My feelings releasing a project and getting no users It sucks. And its basically the worst outcome. And its what I expected to happen.
Our marketing plan was an after thought:
Make a post on Reddit Make a post on indie hackers Make a post on twitter And the results, of course, are nothing.</description>

      <title>Why I Make Waitlists For Side Projects</title>

      <description>1. External validation for a new idea At the start of a project, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if only I have the problem I want to solve.
The more emails that join my wait list, the more excited people are about solving the problem.
I try to be super straight up about who my product is for on the landing page. I also try to scope down the communicated project features as much as possible.</description>

      <description>Today I built a wait list landing page for a new project of mine.
I did it in around 2 hr 55 min. This is a PB for me.
I could definitely have done it faster, but with the trade offs I wanted, I am quite happy.
The Strategy Note: I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with the brands mentioned.
1. Audit current state of drag-and-drop website builders Time: 45 min | Cost: $0</description>

      <description>Reviewing pull requests is a pain in the hole, but a necessary one. It is also massive time sync if you&amp;rsquo;re actually doing it right.
Normal PR Process It often looks like this:
Get slack message: ‚Äúpwetty pwease review my PR :3 pr link‚Äù Open in browser, scroll through the code a bit Inner Monologue: ‚ÄúThis looks mostly understandable? Can I can get away without pulling this locally?‚Äù Decide to run it locally Stash current branch&amp;rsquo;s changes (remember that you have a stash saved!</description>

      <title>On Getting Discovered</title>

      <description>I blog sometimes. I publish a good bit of music as well, and yet, no one knows me. This is fine. I happily mosey through life without internet celebrity, but candidly (and probably humanly), it would be nice to get recognition for the things that I make. So how does one get &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo;? Youtube just recommended me this small linux youtuber, who struck me with a Jimmy Neutron style, brain blast on how these algorithms likely work.</description>

      <title>Making A Language Learning Buddy w/ ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://c0n0.com/posts/chat-gpt-buddy/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at a quietly frustrating point with my German language learning. It&amp;rsquo;s an uncomfortable expanse within A1-A2 levels where I pick up a myriad of words in a conversation, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not confident enough to say much. The usual solution here is one of brute force. Go make a fool of yourself, often and brazenly, in the wild. Talk to people around you, have awkward-as-hell conversations. But, how can I cash in on the ChatGPT hype that way?</description>

      <description>Scientists keep logbooks for their findings. Why don&amp;rsquo;t computer scientists? A great place to start doing this is for debugging. Debugging sucks enough as is, make it easier on yourself. A logbook will&amp;hellip;
üó∫ Enumerate where you are in the bug fix journey. You&amp;rsquo;ll forget this journey when you pick it up tomorrow, write it down.
üå≥ Keep you rooted to the ground. (Creating an &amp;ldquo;issue stack&amp;rdquo;.) Related to above, it often feels like you&amp;rsquo;re completely lost in the aether when you&amp;rsquo;re 50 opened browser tabs deep into an issue that&amp;rsquo;s not even the same issue anymore, its a sub issue of a sub issue.</description>
