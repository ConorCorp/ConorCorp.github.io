# What are my 2024 (year) goals?

1. ðŸŸ¡ Release/Work on 3 startup projects. Build them faster, throw them out faster.
   - I need to build quickly and release quickly. I need to clear time in my schedule for this.
   - Related lifetime goal: Run my own business.
2. ðŸŸ¡ Show off 12 items of my work in public. 1 per month atleast.
   - I should build my projects in public. I should have my music out in public more. I should write blog posts. I enjoy the feedback.
   - Related lifetime goal: Run my own business / Have 100k fans of my music.
3. ðŸŸ¡ Curate and keep to a more regular routine. 6hr side projects. Wake up by 8am.
   - Atleast 6hrs per week on music / side projects.
     - Decide on Sundays what I want to achieve with the week
   - Wake up by 8 regularly and work on my projects in the morning.
     - I do better work in the morning and need to keep this routine. Otherwise I'm tired at night and just watch tv.
   - Reduce my obligations/stress so that I have time to work on projects / music. I feel stressed with all the things I must do. I don't have time for my passions then, and I also can't stop and smell the roses in life.
   - Define what I'll achieve each week.
4. ðŸ”´ Release 4 SE.CORP songs. Set up a repeatable way to get listeners / viewers.
5. ðŸŸ¡ Develop a better musical ear 
   - I'd like to more readily be able to find notes, tab out songs, and jam over other songs


# What are my lifetime goals?

1. Run my own business that allows me to: support myself, be relaxed, be innovative, love my work, travel.
2. Backpack for 6 months through Asia.
3. Have 100,000 fans of my music.
4. Be relaxed and be excited to wake up to my life every day, and these days are meaningful long-term.
